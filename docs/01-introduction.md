# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose of this Document
Lay out the complete technical plan for **THE BRIDGE** — covering its philosophy, architecture, database design, JSON templates, rules engine, UI, security, integrations, reporting, testing, deployment, and maintenance.  
This document serves as the **working technical specification** for development and future handover.

## 1.2 Audience
This document is intended for **developers**, **system architects**, and other **technical stakeholders** involved in the design, implementation, and maintenance of **THE BRIDGE**.

## 1.3 Background
**THE BRIDGE** is built on Luca’s **3P3** direction — *everything is a process*.  
The architecture is based on three core tables and a small set of generic engines, making the system **metadata-driven** rather than hard-coded.
