# 3. System Objectives

## 3.1 Client-Defined Process Templates
Clients will define their own process templates.  
A **Process Manager** will enable them to create new “modules” simply by designing templates — no schema changes required.  
Each template defines behavior, form layout, and flow rules, letting clients model any business process independently.

## 3.2 Centralized Logging
A single **ledger (Logs)** records every instance and step across all processes.  
This unified log enables full traceability — from the origin of an action to its result — without needing separate audit tables.

## 3.3 Speed and Scale
The system prioritizes performance and responsiveness:  
- Lean layouts  
- Indexed fields  
- Efficient **ExecuteSQL** calls for targeted reads  

These principles ensure scalability even as process volume grows.

## 3.4 Transparency
Every activity within the system is traceable:  
- Clear task assignments  
- Real-time status visibility  
- Precise timestamps  
- Actor history  

Together, these provide end-to-end accountability for every workflow.
