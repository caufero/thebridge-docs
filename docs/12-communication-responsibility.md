### 12.3 Notification and Escalation System

#### 12.3.1 Rules (Structured)
| Type | Rule |
|------|------|
| **Immediate notification** | When a **task is assigned**, the *User* is notified instantly |
| **Escalation after 24h** | If task remains incomplete → escalate: **Task → Responsible → Manager → Director** |
| **Broadcasting** | **Critical events** are broadcast to multiple teams (e.g., blocked workflows, failed triggers, expired SLAs) |

#### 12.3.2 Rules (Verbatim)
- **Immediate notification:** Task assigned  
- **Escalation after 24h:** Task → Responsible → Manager → Director  
- **Broadcasting:** Critical events to multiple teams
