## 10. Operational Flow

### 10.1 Process Manager Configuration Flow

#### Description
This flow outlines how a manager defines and configures a process using the **Process Manager** interface.  
The configuration steps ensure that each process has its attributes, relationships, and workflow logic properly generated and tracked across the system.

---

#### Flow Steps
1. **Manager selects or creates a process** in the TreeView interface.  
2. **Defines necessary attributes** required for the process.  
3. **Configures relationships and triggers** to link processes and automate behavior.  
4. **System automatically generates** the following components:
   - **Template in `CMP`** (Component Definition)
   - **User Interface** for data interaction
   - **Workflow in `ETY`** (Entity Definitions)
   - **Tracking in `LOG`** (Activity Logs)

---

#### Notes
- The TreeView serves as the visual entry point for managing processes hierarchically.  
- Attributes define the data model, while relationships control how entities interact.  
- Triggers enable automation (e.g., automatic updates, notifications, or workflow transitions).  
- Generated elements maintain consistent linkage between CMP, ETY, and LOG tables for full traceability.

#### Example
When a new **“Client Onboarding”** process is created:
1. The manager defines attributes such as *Client Name*, *Assigned Officer*, and *Start Date*.  
2. A trigger is set to notify the assigned officer once onboarding begins.  
3. The system generates the necessary template (`CMP`), workflow (`ETY`), and logging rules (`LOG`) automatically.  
4. A user interface layout is also generated for process tracking and updates.
